# Real-Time-Fog-Simulation-Based-on-Environmental-Parameters
Engineered a real-time volumetric fog engine in OpenGL, utilizing raymarching with stochastic dithering and volumetric shadow mapping for dynamic occlusion. Implemented the Henyey-Greenstein phase function to simulate anisotropic single-scattering physics and exponential height falloff for realistic atmospheric density. Integrated a dynamic day-night cycle with light kinematics and 6-DOF camera movement for interactive scene exploration.
